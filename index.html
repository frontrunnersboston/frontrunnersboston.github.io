	<h1>Welcome! </h1>

	<p>Frontrunners Boston is Boston’s first LGBTQ+ running club, founded
	in 1979.  Every Thursday evening and every Saturday morning, we meet
	and go running along the Charles River. Some people go for a 3 mile
	loop, some for a 5.6 mile loop, and some for a 7.8 mile loop. Some
	people walk, some people run. Everybody has a good time.</p>

	<p>Our typical meeting times are every Thursday at 7pm in or outside
		the <a

		flagpole</a>. Wear a mask.</p>

	<p>On occasion we switch things up. This summer, we sometimes ran on
	Thursday evenings from Davis Square in Somerville to <a

	Beach in Mystic Lakes State Park</a> and swam. For up-to-date
	information about our plans this week, please join <a

<div id="run" class="content">

<h1>Saturday Run</h1>

<p>Saturday Run is our main weekly activity. Come out and join us every
	Saturday at 10 am (9 am on the Saturday of Pride) <s>in front of Club
	Cafe at 209 Columbus Avenue (near the corner of Berkeley &amp;
	Columbus)</s> near the tall flagpole in Boston’s Public Garden,
	wearing a mask.</p>

<p>If you need to drop off your stuff, show up a bit early and drop it off in
	one of our members’ cars. After the run, we wait until everyone
	returns and then chat at a distance. If the public health situation
	allows it, we will get food from places nearby (such as Flour, Boloco,
	or Au Bon Pain) and hang out and eat at the Boston Public Garden (when
	the weather is nice) or at the lobby of the Atrium on St. James Ave
	(when the weather is not so nice).</p>

<h1>How to get to the run</h1>

<p>The meeting point is very easy to get to by the subway. The closest T
	station is Arlington on the Green Line; Back Bay Station on the Orange
	Line is not far. If you are driving, there are plenty of 2-hour
	metered parking spots and the Common Garage.</p>

<h1>Route maps</h1>

<p>There are three different loops, varying by where you want to turn around.
	If you're a newcomer, at least one of us will be running with you to
	make sure you're not lost.</p>

<p><i>Please note that our current routes start in the Public Garden rather
	than at Club Café.</i></p>

<ol> <li> 3 miles. Start off the same as everyone but turn around once you get
	to the river<br/> <a href="images/routes/3miles.png" target="_blank">
	<img class="map" src="images/routes/3miles.png"> </img></a> </li>

     <li>~6 miles. Crossing Harvard bridge. <br/> <a
		href="images/routes/6miles.png" target="_blank">     <img
		class="map" src="images/routes/6miles.png"> </img></a> </li>

     <li>~8 miles. Skip Harvard Bridge, run to BU Bridge, cross the river, and get back. This route is tricky. Note how we cut through the BU campus on the map.<br/>

	</ol>

<h1>Thursday Run</h1>

<p>Thursday Run starts at 7pm in Cambridge. We meet outside
(or inside when it is cold) the MIT Student Center.</p>

<p>If you're coming for the first time and/or need a place to store your
things, you should definitely reach out to the Facebook group or e-mail
rnicoll {{at}} brandeis {{dot}} edu.</p>

<h1>How to get to the run</h1>

<p>The run is between the Central and Kendall/MIT stops on the Red Line. It is
about a 0.5 mile walk from each station. The No. 1 bus also brings you right
near the MIT Student Center, as well.</p>

<h1>Route map</h1>

<ol> <li>4.5 miles. This is the route everyone takes on Thursday. We start at
	the MIT Student Center and end <s>outside Saloniki, a restaurant a bit
	further down the street</s> where we started. </br> <a

<div id="newcomers" class="content">
	<h1>How do I participate?</h1>
	<p>The best way is to join us is to run with us on a Saturday. We welcome new members of all ages, sizes, and running mileages. Out-of-towners and visitors are welcome as well. All you need to do is to show up and run! We are very friendly people. More detail on Saturday runs can be found <a class="menu_item" href="run">here</a>. And to stay updated with our club updates and news, please join our <a target="_blank" href="https://www.facebook.com/groups/FRBoston">Front Runners Boston Facebook group</a>. </p>
	<h1>What should I expect on my first Saturday run? </h1>
	<p>First, look for good looking people in running gear on Saturday morning and say hi. We are always keen on welcoming new members. We will go around and introduce ourselves before we start running. At least one of us will be running with you to make sure you’re not lost.</p>
	<h1>Besides Saturday runs, what else do you guys do? </h1>
	<p>We have our Thursday run at 7 pm in Cambridge outside of the MIT Student Center. In addition to this, we occasionally have social events or run races outside of Boston together. You should definitely join or subscribe to our facebook group as we actively post our next social events, upcoming races, updates, etc. on the page. We also advertise these events at the beginning of Saturday run.</p>
	<h1>Is there a membership fee?</h1>
	<p>No. The club is free and open to everyone. No registrations, secret handshakes, or hanky codes.</p>
	<h1>I still have questions. Can I talk to someone? </h1>
